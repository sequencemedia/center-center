# center-center

For calculating the `left` and `top` position coordinates of a vertically and horizontalled centered target element within a container (according to the position of the vieport)

In other words ...

The target is at the _center center_ of its container here

The position of the vertically and horizontalled centered target element _changes_ according to how the container is contained in the viewports
